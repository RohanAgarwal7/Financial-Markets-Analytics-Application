# Financial Market Analytics Application

## Overview
The Financial Market Analytics Application is a comprehensive tool designed to aggregate, process, and analyse financial data from diverse sources, including fundamental metrics, sentiment data from news and social media, and technical indicators. Leveraging advanced AI, particularly fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), the application provides actionable insights into stock performance through an interactive dashboard. The entire solution is containerised using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy deployment and reproducibility.

## Features
- **Data Aggregation**: Collects fundamental metrics (e.g., earnings, ratios), sentiment data (news, social media), and technical indicators (e.g., RSI, moving averages) from multiple financial APIs such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Google News API.
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load data into a containerised database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB), ensuring data integrity and security.
- **Machine Learning Analysis**: Utilises fine-tuned LLMs for domain-specific sentiment analysis and incorporates predictive models for stock trend forecasting.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Responsive web or mobile interface displaying trends and visualisations for significant market changes.
- **Containerised Deployment**: Fully containerised using Docker, with Docker Compose for orchestrating multi-container setups, enabling portable and reproducible deployments.

## Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+ for data pipeline and ML components
- Node.js (for web frontend, if applicable)
- Access to financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)
- Optional: Kafka for real-time streaming

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-market-analytics.git
   cd financial-market-analytics


Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory.
Add API keys for financial data providers (e.g., ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY, GOOGLE_NEWS_API_KEY).
Specify database credentials and other configurations (e.g., DB_HOST, DB_USER).


Build and Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

This command builds and starts all containers (API, database, ML models, frontend).

Access the Application

Open the dashboard in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port).
For mobile, configure the app as per the /docs/mobile_setup.md guide.


Run Tests
docker-compose exec app pytest /data_pipeline/tests



Usage

Dashboard: Navigate the interactive dashboard to view stock trends, sentiment analysis, and technical indicators. Customise visualisations and set up alerts for market events.
